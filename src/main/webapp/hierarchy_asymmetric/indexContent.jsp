<h2>Resource Hierarchy Solution</h2>
<div class="description">
    <img src="../pictures/resource.svg" alt="Dining Philosophers Problem" width="400" height="350"> <br>

    <p>
        The resource hierarchy solution to the Dining Philosophers Problem works by assigning a unique order to the chopsticks (resources), numbered from 0 to (nâˆ’1).
        Philosophers always attempt to pick up the lower-numbered chopstick first before picking up the higher-numbered one.
        This forces all philosophers, except one, to act "left-handed" (they pick up the left chopstick first).
        One philosopher (the last one in the circle) will act as the "right-handed," picking up their right chopstick first.

        This strategy is effective in preventing deadlock because it eliminates the circular wait condition by Coffman.
        Since philosophers always pick up chopsticks in a consistent order, no circular chain of waiting can form.
        At least one philosopher will always be able to proceed, ensuring the system avoids deadlock and allowing each philosopher to eventually eat.

    <p>
        To implement the Resource Hierarchy solution, only the run function in the philosopher class has to be modified:
        For this purpose we create a Subclass and add the according changes.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        [PseudoCode]

        class HierarchyPhilosopher extends Philosopher {
            //pickup chopstick with lower id first

            HierarchyPhilosopher(int id, Chopstick leftChopstick, Chopstick rightChopstick) {
                super(id, leftChopstick, rightChopstick);
            }

            run() {
                while (!terminate()) {
                    think();
                    if(leftChopstick.getId() < rightChopstick.getId()){
                        pickUpLeftChopstick();
                        pickUpRightChopstick();
                        eat();
                        putDownLeftChopstick();
                        putDownRightChopstick();
                    } else {
                        pickUpRightChopstick();
                        pickUpLeftChopstick();
                        eat();
                        putDownRightChopstick();
                        putDownLeftChopstick();
                    }
            }
        }
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        Now let us evaluate the given Algorithm according to the key challenges we face for designing a dining philosophers solution:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deadlocks: Resource Hierarchy effectively prevents deadlocks</li>
        <li>Fairness: Resource Hierarchy fails at providing fairness to the system, as no such measures are taken.</li>
        <li>TODO::Concurrency: Concurrency of the system is given, since the philosophers are not prevented from eating by this approach.</li>
        <li>Implementation: The changes required to implement this solution are minimal, no complex logic needed. </li>
        <li>TODO:: Performance:  </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Asymmetric Solution</h2>
<div class="description">
    <img src="../pictures/asymmetric.svg" alt="Dining Philosophers Problem" width="400" height="350"> <br>
    <p>
        The Asymmetric Solution takes a slightly different approach by assigning an order to the philosophers instead of the chopsticks.
        Philosophers with an even number pick up the left chopstick first, while those with an odd number pick up the right chopstick first.
        By alternating the order of chopstick pickups between even and odd philosophers, the system prevents deadlocks by avoiding the circular wait condition by Coffman.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        To implement the Asymmetric solution, only the run function in the philosopher class has to be modified:
        For this purpose we create a Subclass and add the according changes.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        [PseudoCode]

        public class AsymmetricPhilosopher extends Philosopher {

            public AsymmetricPhilosopher(int id, Chopstick leftChopstick, Chopstick rightChopstick) {
                super(id, leftChopstick, rightChopstick);
            }

            run() {
                boolean even = id % 2 == 0;
                while (!terminated()) {
                    think();
                    if(even){
                        pickUpLeftChopstick();
                        pickUpRightChopstick();
                        eat();
                        putDownLeftChopstick();
                        putDownRightChopstick();
                    } else {
                        pickUpRightChopstick();
                        pickUpLeftChopstick();
                        eat();
                        putDownRightChopstick();
                        putDownLeftChopstick();
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        <li>Implementation: The changes required to implement this solution are quite minimal, no complex logic needed. </li>
