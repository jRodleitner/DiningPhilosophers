GENERAL TODO:

NEXT:
[ ] check all algorithms
[ ] read approaches/ papers for new algorithms
[ ] try simplifying animation/ simulation page
[ ] inspect simulation logic for each Algorithm!!!

OPTIONALS:
TIMEOUT(Time-index)
[ ] Separate Events for: Timeout, Waiter etc...?? (Animation)
[ ] Correct eatTime-fairness calculation (less clear stdv, but more exact)
[ ] instant timeout

IDEAS:

    Poor Philosopher??

    Totmannverfahren: separate program entity preventing/ checking for deadlocks.


    FORK SEMAPHORE:
    Dijkstra's solution using semaphores:
    Assign a semaphore to each chopstick, representing its availability.
    Philosophers must acquire both chopsticks by locking their corresponding semaphores.
    If a philosopher cannot acquire both chopsticks, they release the acquired chopstick and wait before trying again.
