IDEAS:

    Poor Philosopher??

    Totmannverfahren: separate program entity preventing/ checking for deadlocks.


    FORK SEMAPHORE:
    Dijkstra's solution using semaphores:
    Assign a semaphore to each chopstick, representing its availability.
    Philosophers must acquire both chopsticks by locking their corresponding semaphores.
    If a philosopher cannot acquire both chopsticks, they release the acquired chopstick and wait before trying again.
